# SoulBot

A little Minecraft plugin / Discord bot that allows for account synchronization between a Minecraft and a Discord server.
This plugin was in use for the SoulUnity Minecraft server during its uptime.

The config data and needed API tokens are stored inside a class (the uploaded version is just blank) because of set constraints in my environment.
 **I highly advise to change this and deposit the tokens savely!**

_**The project is organized in a maven repository and should be imported as such to avoid issues!**_
